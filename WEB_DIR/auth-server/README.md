### Note: this needs a ```.env``` file to run.

The file should contain 
```
CLIENT_ID=SPOTIFY_API_KEY
CLIENT_SECRET=SPOTIFY_API_KEY
BACKEND_URL=WHERE_THIS_IS_HOSTED
FRONTEND_URL=WHERE_FRONTEND_IS_HOSTED
USE_SSL=FALSE
```

Note that the Spotify API needs to have ```BACKEND_URL/callback``` recorded as a callback url.
