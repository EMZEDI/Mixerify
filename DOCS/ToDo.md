## TODO
1. Finish backend and render the website - ask spotify to verify
2. test the model using the recommended approaches (visualizing + finding the distances + cutting a top hit playlist 
in half and checking of the omitted part is suggested or not (dawn fm the weeknd))
3. Update the main dataset using more playlists and confirming that it only contains new songs 21/22.
